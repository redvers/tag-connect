Greetings.

Here you can find diptrace component and pattern file for all of the
tag-connect connectors.

Some of the objects are already created by anonymous individuals and they
appear to be in the public domain and distributed by the manufacturer.

I have stored these files in the original-inputs directory.

I have re-designed the patterns because they all fail to meet the requirements
of the datasheet.  Specifically, they ALL fail to remove the pad from the
paste layer.

I'll endeavor to make the libraries I provide as accurate to the datasheets
as I can.
